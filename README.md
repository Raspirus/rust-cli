# Rust command-line interface

## Archived and merged
This project was the second stage of the Raspirus project, where we switched from Python to Rust, increasing the speed and efficiency of Raspirus.
It is not documented and won't be developed further, because the main repo now has a CLI-only option you can use instead.

The rust-cli repo should only be used for benchmarks and related stuff. Don't use it in production, unless you know what you do!
